# brickout
A fun game of brickout for laptop/pc, made with pygame. Includes powerups.
The controls are easy to understand, click left key to move left, and right key to move right. 
The target device must contain pygame for the game to work. No other image resources are required for the game. There are currently only 2 levels in the game, I plan on adding more. If anyone wants to add more levels by themselves, they are free to do so.
